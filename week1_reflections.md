# What I've learned so far
This week, I was introduced to a lot.
We started with learning about computers- specifically, stuff like the CPU, RAM, etc. I learned stuff about my Macbook I didn't know before. 
Something especially interesting to me is how everything on my Mac is on one chip made by Apple, while other computers may have components from different companies and such. Though I know it 
is possible to add an external GPU if I so wanted.
We then also begun to actually learn about Python. We learned comments, variables, operations, and much more. My favorite thing to learn about was input! This allows for the user to
interact with the code, which is great to start coding some simple, low level programs.
I am excited for the coming weeks as I learn more about Python!
