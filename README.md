A repository to document my Python learning journey

### About me

<p> Hello, my name is Afrah and I am currently completing an <strong> introduction to Python course</strong>! This repository will document my journey in learning and understanding the Python language. </p> <p> Some more information about me: I love to read, code, and watch videos. I have learned Java through AP CS A, so I am not totally new to programming, I know some basic programming concepts. Overall I'm a pretty chill person and I 
like to challenge myself by learning new skills, as I am doing now with Python! </p>

### Goals for this course

<p> I hope to attain a solid foundational understanding of Python, of which in the future I can effectively build more skills on. I've known some Python
but only very basic things which I have not drilled very well into my mind. Learning this language properly will give me a really good basic 
knowledge of Python, off of which I can take more classes or learn more on my own to go into my own specialties. I am interested in ML, for example, so knowing this Python will let me interact with Python libraries like PyTorch. </p>

### My first python program

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

Simple print to terminal! <strong>Excited for this course</strong>!
