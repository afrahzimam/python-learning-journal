A repository to document my Python learning journey

### About me
Hello, my name is Afrah and I am currently completing an introduction to Python course! This repository will document my journey in learning and understanding the Python language. Some more information about me: I love to read, code, and watch videos. I have learned Java through AP CS A,
so I am not totally new to programming, I know some basic programming concepts. Overall I'm a pretty chill person and I 
like to challenge myself by learning new skills, as I am doing now with Python!
### Goals for this course
I hope to attain a solid foundational understanding of Python, of which in the future I can effectively build more skills on. I've known some Python
but only very basic things which I have not drilled very well into my mind. Learning this language properly will give me a really good basic 
knowledge of Python, off of which I can take more classes or learn more on my own to go into my own specialties. I am interested in ML, for example,
so knowing this Python will let me interact with Python libraries like PyTorch.
### My first python program
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
Simple print to terminal! Excited for this course!
